<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Merveilles Katumba Biende, and I come from the Democratic Republic of Congo. I'm 31 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University at Buffalo. I've also completed some courses at Erie Community College as part of my academic journey.</p>
    <p>Before this, I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering in South Africa and lived there for 10 years. During my time in South Africa, I had the opportunity to explore vibrant cities like Cape Town, Johannesburg, Durban, and Port Elizabeth.</p>
    <p>In addition to my travels in South Africa, I've also visited Antananarivo in Madagascar. My passion for exploration and learning has been fueled by my experiences as a missionary, where I had the chance to volunteer and travel extensively.</p>
    <p>Currently, I reside in the United States, specifically in New York state, in the city of Buffalo, where I continue to pursue my academic and personal growth.</p>
